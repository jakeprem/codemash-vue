Ever since the Agile Manifesto was drafted in February of 2001, the principles of agile software development have come to dominate the way we go about building systems. Over the last few years, an evolution of that agile thinking has emerged under the banner of Lean. Much like agile, the emphasis is on getting rapid feedback and embracing change. But where agile is primarily focused on how you go about building software the right way, lean thinking broadens that to ensure you're building the right thing in the first place. In this workshop, we'll give you some practical experience in how to work this way. We'll start by forming small cross-functional teams and ensure each has a product idea (either one of their own or one that is assigned). Then, each team will put into practice the lean practices that are designed to help you eliminate wasted time and effort in finding product/market fit. You'll identify core underlying assumptions about the product/business. Then you'll design and conduct experiments which can help you assess the validity of those assumptions. Based on what you learn, you'll adjust the core idea and iterate until you have a product idea that is better than what you started with. This is a great session for the technical and non-technical alike.","SessionType":"Pre-Compiler","Tags":["Soft Skills / Business"],"Category":"Project Leadership/Soft Skills","Speakers":[{"Id":"62af80c8-3be2-4f11-a8fe-431cef56f470","FirstName":"Mike","LastName":"Doel","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/8222fc5b70178fdc4a898cdcf2a2a2d7"},{"Id":"828ef2f4-ecb0-4649-913d-823d0b482560","FirstName":"Samuel","LastName":"Bowles","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/72591991c085f345ab4a93cb2b0eb692"}]},{"Id":3663,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-05T09:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-05T10:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Acacia - Sessionz"],"Title":"Kidz‐in‐3D","Abstract":"Make a tetrahedron with 6 toothpick.

Do you get everything you need right out of the box, or do you have to NPM/Bower something to get any real work done? In this session, you will learn not one web framework, but TWO. We will start by looking at what makes each of these frameworks \"tick\". Then we will apply this information to build a simple web application in both frameworks, utilizing the same back-end for both client apps. You will leave this session with a solid understanding of how both Angular and Ember work, where they are similar and where they differ, and what the development experience is like in both. You will also be armed with the knowledge needed to decide if Angular or Ember would be better suited for that next web project that comes your way.

Previously, we had Hadoop's MapReduce framework for batch processing, but modern big data processing demands have outgrown this framework. That's where Apache Spark steps in, boasting speeds 10-100x faster than Hadoop and setting the world record in large scale sorting. Spark's general abstraction means it can expand beyond simple batch processing, making it capable of such things as blazing-fast, iterative algorithms and exactly once streaming semantics. In this session, you'll learn Spark from the ground up, starting with its history before creating a Wikipedia analysis application as one of the means for learning a wide scope of its core API. That core knowledge will make it easier to look into Spark's other libraries, such as the streaming and SQL APIs. Finally you'll learn how to avoid a few commonly encountered rough edges of Spark. You will leave this session with a tool belt capable of creating your own performance-maximized Spark application.

Ever since the Agile Manifesto was drafted in February of 2001, the principles of agile software development have come to dominate the way we go about building systems. Over the last few years, an evolution of that agile thinking has emerged under the banner of Lean. Much like agile, the emphasis is on getting rapid feedback and embracing change. But where agile is primarily focused on how you go about building software the right way, lean thinking broadens that to ensure you're building the right thing in the first place. In this workshop, we'll give you some practical experience in how to work this way. We'll start by forming small cross-functional teams and ensure each has a product idea (either one of their own or one that is assigned). Then, each team will put into practice the lean practices that are designed to help you eliminate wasted time and effort in finding product/market fit. You'll identify core underlying assumptions about the product/business. Then you'll design and conduct experiments which can help you assess the validity of those assumptions. Based on what you learn, you'll adjust the core idea and iterate until you have a product idea that is better than what you started with.

You get to deliver great software without writing big upfront requirements documents or creating reams of documentation on the back end.  But many teams who adopt user stories soon find themselves struggling and ultimately disappointed with the outcome.  Vague details, half-baked story ideas, and no clear agreement on a when a story is truly “done” can all plague teams who are just getting their head around user stories.\r\n\r\nBut this doesn’t have the be the case.  The simplicity of user stories are often their downfall, but with just a few tricks you can create lightweight user stories that address all of the problems mentioned above.  During this workshop you’ll learn how to quickly create stories that clearly convey their intention, specify their done states, and always keep their target users in mind.  You’ll even learn a few advanced techniques for keeping your head above the trees and keeping the context of your stories from getting lost in the weeds.  Once we’re finished, you’ll be ready to write stories for your team that help set the direction and keep them on track all without writing heavy documentation.  It’s time to say goodbye to giant requirements documents and hello to the new world of lightweight user stories.","SessionType":"Pre-Compiler","Tags":["Soft Skills / Business"],"Category":"Project Leadership/Soft Skills","Speakers":[{"Id":"0f94dfc9-41b0-42b4-a35e-bcde8687206a","FirstName":"Jeremy","LastName":"Jarrell","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2d015ea83f08f3953afb22c95d78a2b3"}]},{"Id":3571,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-06T13:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-06T17:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Indigo Bay"],"Title":"Testing RESTful Web services","Abstract":"Testing RESTful Web services \r\n\r\nRESTful software architecture is becoming more and more popular as a choice for applications and this poses new and interesting challenges and opportunities for Testers.

All of it.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, Jeffrey A. Miller demonstrates how Neo4j, a powerful graph database, can be used to model critical parts of an application and the processes that surround it. Using Neo4j’s compelling visualizations and the way-cool CYPHER query language, you’ll see how you can model the connections between the stuff your team cares about, the stuff you’ve completely forgotten, and even the stuff you never even saw coming.\r\n\r\nImagine connecting work items to test cases to code artifacts to team members and deployment environments. Find answers to important questions, like: “If I change this code, what could I break, and what will QA need to retest?” “This CSS is a mess! Where are these files used in the app?” “We need answers about feature X. What developer worked on this? Who can answer my questions?”\r\n\r\nYou’ll see how you can tame the chaos and use graph databases to model the way out.","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["Soft Skills / Business","Other"],"Category":"Data (big/small/otherwise)","Speakers":[{"Id":"ddd80c06-89e7-4401-a47f-ee5073355645","FirstName":"Jeffrey","LastName":"Miller","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/40a0418b1d95abcba56f4b373a06dac4"}]},{"Id":3790,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-07T08:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-07T09:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Mangrove"],"Title":"Software In Motion: Continuous Delivery for Mobile","Abstract":"The top mobile applications release updates every 45 days or less. In order to meet the demands of a frequent release schedule, automation is in order; this demand can't be met manually no matter how much caffeine is introduced into the process. Also, it's well known that finding bugs earlier reduces the cost of eliminating them. Continuous delivery (CD) extends continuous integration, providing a system to speed up the process of delivering apps and finding bugs. For mobile apps CD is even harder given that an app probably consists of at least three platforms: iOS, Android, and a set of web services. This session covers the options and components for constructing a continuous delivery system for client and server applications, centered on extending continuous integration using a plethora of supporting tools. You'll learn how to handle difficult mobile problems in CD like app signing and publishing different app configurations that target test or production environments. The system demonstrated performs static analysis, runs unit tests and functional tests, and publishes to endpoints such as containers, app publishing platforms, and even mobile device management systems.

When a new team says they're using Git, do you wonder why they're turning up their noses at the centralized VCS you know? Everybody understands adding, committing, pushing and pulling; but trying to understand Git with the same paradigm as you approach centralized version control systems is a recipe for fear, uncertainty & doubt. Git doesn't work like a centralized version control system, which can be confusing. If you want to understand how Git truly IS different, this session is for you. Git becomes much easier to understand, once you approach it with the understanding that it's fundamentally different from a centralized VCS. The goal of this talk is to shed some light on how Git works under the hood. To develop a mental model of how Git works, we'll start with, \"The Git Parable,\" by Tom Preston-Warner. We'll take a look at some of Git’s core concepts including its basic object storage, how commits work, how branches and tags work, and we’ll look at the different kinds of merging in Git (yes, including rebase).

Well this session is going to kick that up a notch and talk about getting the family to \"hack\" together. It starts out discussing the different forms of hacking a family might embrace and at what age levels each might be best suited. Along the way it highlights what supplies, tools and equipment you might need, as well as suggesting the overall costs that one might expect to incur. It then takes a brief focus on safety and proper use of those tools and equipment.

REST provides a convenient, lightweight and stateless way for clients to consume such services.\r\nHowever many services continue to expose APIs that were designed for the pre-smartphone era. This has proven to be a nightmare for mobile app developers who have to now figure out ways to retrofit an API that just does not work for them.\r\nThis talk provides an overview of the guiding principles behind a RESTful Interface, focusing on aspects that are critical for mobile environments. It explores the specific limitations and requirements of mobile environments and how to define an API that will adapt to such environments.

However basic FSM cannot easily handle noisy data such as sensor data from a wearable device that is generated using human limb movement. This session presents a novel variation of FSM using techniques from functional programming to construct 'functional' state machines (FnSM) that are computationally as efficient as FSM but can handle probabilistic patterns almost as well as more elaborate techniques such as Hidden Markov Models.\r\n\r\nA real-world application of FnSM is described; an Android smartwatch app that recognizes gestures performed using wrist and forearm movements. Also described is the use of an evolutionary computing algorithm to optimize the performance of the FnSM by selecting better parameter values for the various state-transition decisions.\r\n\r\nWe are increasingly living in a word where data processing needs to happen in real-time to enable quicker decision making. FSM are an essential technique for recognizing patterns over sequential data. This talk describes techniques that leverage FP to succinctly define complex FSM.

Velocity is simply a measurement of speed in a given direction-the rate at which a team is delivering toward a product release. As with a vehicle en route to a particular destination, increasing the speed may appear to ensure a timely arrival. However, that assumption is dangerous because it ignores the risks with higher speeds. And while it’s easy to increase a vehicle’s speed, where exactly is the accelerator on a software team? Michael “Doc\" Norton walks us through the Hawthorne Effect and Goodhart’s Law to explain why setting goals for velocity can actually hurt a project's chances. Take a look at what can negatively impact velocity, ways to stabilize fluctuating velocity, and methods to improve velocity without the risks. Leave with a toolkit of additional metrics that, coupled with velocity, give a better view of the project's overall health.","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["Soft Skills / Business","Other"],"Category":"Project Leadership/Soft Skills","Speakers":[{"Id":"ffc7a643-0bb7-4bc0-80aa-f6fed454ab8b","FirstName":"Doc","LastName":"Norton","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/25105530ccd2893959e16bb14871f88f"}]},{"Id":3528,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-07T13:00:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-07T14:00:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Zambezi"],"Title":"Angular 2 in Plain JavaScript","Abstract":"\r\nAngular sure seemed like a good idea...that is, until Angular 2 was announced.

By looking at  designs from a new angle we can critically examine current UX standards, dive deeper into understanding user pain points, and step outside our normal design-thinking process.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this talk you'll know:\r\n\r\n(1) Why coming up with bad ideas is actually SUPER useful\r\n(2)  New ways to critically examine your designs\r\n(3) How to use Contrarian Design as a brainstorming and concept generation technique\r\n(4) How to use Contrarian Design as a user research method","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["Design (UI/UX/CSS)","Soft Skills / Business"],"Category":"Design (UI/UX)","Speakers":[{"Id":"537c9500-f03a-4e56-8f63-b4b49f11d75d","FirstName":"Katie","LastName":"Quehl","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/97d9e5bff73fb8f642c21127e594d145"}]},{"Id":4100,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-07T16:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-07T17:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Mangrove"],"Title":"Well Behaved Elixir","Abstract":"As developers, types are a part of our lives.

Issues with technical innovation, resource constraints, and organizational support, are experienced not only in zeros and ones but on the road and in space.\r\n\r\nIn the early 20th century, the U.S. was considered a global leader in economic and scientific achievement. After those major innovations in transportation, space exploration, and computer science, American industries focused on manufacturing advantages, such as mass production and repeatable use. Progress was now measured by process improvements, adapting to market changes and ability to pivot. Why has the tech industry continued to boom, while other industries struggle? Using examples from General Motors and NASA, this talk examines their failures in reliability, collaboration, and product design. Take a step back in history to relive the experiences of these pioneers, learn from their past failures, and how they apply to crafting software products today.","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["Design (UI/UX/CSS)","Testing","Soft Skills / Business","Other"],"Category":"Programming Principles","Speakers":[{"Id":"7ecd079b-3768-4fd0-81f5-8a218bf95d4d","FirstName":"Charlotte","LastName":"Chang","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/08162d08036ded3d5aac75b19d97fbd5"}]},{"Id":4158,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-08T12:15:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-08T13:15:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Orange"],"Title":"UX Survival Guide for Agile Development","Abstract":"Welcome to Agile - you get put on a team as a designer and you feel like you’re just trying to keep your head above the water.

It is also a topic of discussion that can be very hotly charged and highly contentious within even the most harmonious development teams. We know from experience that there have been many software development managers that have found themselves lying awake at night pondering the following questions:\r\n\r\n- Are software developers naturally terrible at estimating? Or are they just trying to pull the wool over management’s eyes?\r\n\r\n- Is it possible to teach developers to become significantly better at estimating project tasks?\r\n\r\n- Is it possible to address this topic without causing a mutiny on my team?\r\n\r\nIn this session, two highly seasoned software development managers will show you that, thankfully, the answers to the last two questions is a resounding “YES”. They will also discuss how it is possible to transform the culture of your software development team and successfully:  \r\n\r\n- Move away from a culture where the team views estimates as something they will be punished for failing to meet (as is all too often the perception) while also \r\n\r\n- Creating a culture that views estimating as a valuable tool that will make the lives of the team easier by:\r\n\r\n          a.) improving the size and scope of releases,\r\n\r\n          b.) reducing the pressure placed on developers when they are saddled with off-topic task assignments and other time wasters, and \r\n\r\n          c.) increasing the team’s effectiveness and efficiency. \r\n\r\nIf you are currently a member of a team that struggles with producing reliable estimates of project tasks, then you won’t want to miss this enlightening and lively discussion. \r\nPresenters will include Peg Bogema, Stout Systems' Vice President of Operations, and Dave Sweeton, Stout Systems' Chief Technologist. Peg and Dave are seasoned veterans of the software industry. Together, they have managed, executed and implemented hundreds of successful software development projects—and they have the physical and mental scars to show for it!

Unlike the Andromeda Strain before it, the symptoms of this disease, innocuous IFs and CASEs, are quietly waiting for just the right moment to render your software unmaintainable. The agents work slowly and quietly, in the shadows, like digging a hole with a soup spoon.  One day you wake only to realize you've sunk into a pit of technical debt.\r\n\r\nOK, it's probably not that bad, but violating the Open-Closed principle does have the potential to shorten the life of any OO code.  The key is to identify violations as they are occurring so that we keep the power to extend the software without also needing to change it.  This session demonstrates refactoring techniques to eliminate violations of the principle and some tips for identifying the early. Examples are provided mainly in Groovy, but analogous code will be provided in a variety of other languages.\r\n","SessionType":"Sponsor Session","Tags":[],"Category":"Architecture","Speakers":[{"Id":"BD3DFD56-6E61-4F4D-8418-48AA71117D01","FirstName":"","LastName":"Manifest Solutions","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/0fcb4f5b664628e63e92caf05404b8a9"}]},{"Id":5263,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-08T13:30:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-08T14:15:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Mangrove"],"Title":"Let's Make Pie with Xamarin.Forms and Xuni","Abstract":"[Presented by Greg Lutz]\r\nIn this quick session we will show you how to improve the visualization of your data by turning a plain list of data into an interactive, and possibly delicious, pie chart!

In this session we’ll talk about how feature toggles work, where/when they are useful, and how to sell them to your boss.","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["JavaScript","Ruby/Rails",".NET","Java"],"Category":"Enterprise/Large-Shop Development","Speakers":[{"Id":"b01f05aa-8d7f-4695-a130-1140154bff7b","FirstName":"Jarred","LastName":"Olson","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/5a77344f5bfaf6895739f61edb713e6c"}]},{"Id":3083,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-08T14:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-08T15:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Salon A"],"Title":"Elasticsearch for SQL Users","Abstract":"Most developers are familiar with relational databases and its query language, SQL.

These algorithms are a vast improvement over their “classical” predecessors as presented by Knuth and others. Galloping searches that can defeat binary, set intersections in O(n) or less, and  Cuckoo hashes which work in constant time despite collisions are a few examples.\r\n\r\nThrough case studies and demonstrations this session provides an atlas to advances in algorithms and how you can leverage them for fun and profit!\r\n","SessionType":"Regular Session","Tags":["Cloud/Big Data","Other"],"Category":"Programming Principles","Speakers":[{"Id":"db9d27ee-692d-49f0-8866-39dd3d793d43","FirstName":"Matt","LastName":"Williams","GravatarUrl":"//www.gravatar.com/avatar/2354a803ebd8fe473f97b7dc854e4d94"}]},{"Id":4202,"SessionTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00","SessionStartTime":"2016-01-08T14:45:00","SessionEndTime":"2016-01-08T15:45:00","Room":null,"Rooms":["Cypress"],"Title":"Program some health into your life","Abstract":"As programmers we hack everything from our gaming consoles to our home automation systems, but how much time do we spend programming wellness into our lives?
