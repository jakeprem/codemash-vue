The session will begin with a highly interactive, fun and funny magical performance, followed by instructions that will teach the audience members the algorithmic secrets behind some of the effects. Participants will leave this session with a great appreciation for how a clever algorithm can accomplish amazing things along with a handful of “magical” effects they can use to amaze their friends.",

All you do is stick LEDs right into the dough to make it work. Anyone can do it! The first 15 minutes of class the presenter will help you build a simple circuit with LEDs. Then you can use a printed guide (which you get to keep) to select a fun project to work on, or let your imagination run wild and build something crazy! No electronics experience required.  All ages welcome. Kids 5 and under may need some help from parents. Come build something cool and have some fun!",

Tayler Silfverduk will share her first hand lessons in experimenting with fermentation and how she perfected delicious recipes through iterative product development and fast customer feedback. Learn how to make fermented foods - the base ingredients needed, dos and don’ts, the fundamental techniques of fermenting, and keeping cultures alive and thriving. Attendees will put the basics of fermentation to use by starting their own culture during the session and can take them home. Fermentation is a great real world example of how agile product development is iterative and utilizes fast feedback to make a better product.",
